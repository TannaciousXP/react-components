## React

React is "a JavaScript library for building user interfaces," that gives you tools for interacting with the DOM that are cleaner and more performant than with raw JavaScript or jQuery.

React is **declarative**, rather than **imperative**. Imperative code, like raw JavaScript or jQuery, says *how* something ought to occur. Declarative code (HTML being an example) states *what* something ought to be, and hides the *how* away from the developer. Therefore, in React, you write **components** that looks a lot like HTML, and the React library, hidden from you, handles the details of how these components are actually rendered to the DOM.

Think of React components as superpowered HTML tags that:

- Can be given information for how they ought to behave
- Can communicate with each other
- Can be composed, resued and nested together to build small to very large applications

## Setup
